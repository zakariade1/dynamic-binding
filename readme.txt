Basically the way my program works is that you compile it. Then you enter your In this case it is the name of the customer. Then after that it gets to the list. Then after that we will ask the customer which section they want to go either, dog, cat, horse, Then after that. The user interacts with the program. Everything will be then put in a Binary search tree. Then after that it will give option show how many people and what type of animal they chose, remove, remove all. Then after that the loop will continue. At the end we will have the total names of the people who came to our mall
